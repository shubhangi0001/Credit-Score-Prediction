# Credit-Score-Prediction

A machine learning project to predict an individual’s credit score based on financial and behavioral data.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict the credit score of an individual.  
Using historical financial and behavioral datasets, the model learns to classify or estimate a person’s credit score range.  
Key features include:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- (Optional) A front-end or script to make predictions

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have:
- **Windows OS** (instructions below use PowerShell)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **PowerShell** (or equivalent shell for activation)

## 📥 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shubhangi0001/Credit-Score-Prediction.git
cd Credit-Score-Prediction

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment
python -m venv credit_env

### 3️⃣ Activate the virtual environment
D:/Credit_Score_Prediction/.credit_env/Scripts/Activate.ps1

### 4️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 📊 Example Workflow
Load dataset and explore statistics.
Preprocess and clean the data.
Train different ML models (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost).
Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE.
Save the best model for deployment.
